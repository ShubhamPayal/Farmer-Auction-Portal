## Chatbot

The Chatbot has been created using Dialogflow with Botopy being used as the frontend. It has been trained using basic phrases a user may ask, and the response is often static content and general information about the portal.

For detailed help, though, the Chatbot asks for the email of the person, and then the Sendgrid API backend of Dialogflow can reach out to the person who contacted for help.
