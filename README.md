## Approach

We created a web App called Living Seeds which consists of a clear-to-navigate UI, and an exhaustive backend to handle user needs.

We put together the following components for our solution:
- A React.js based web frontend
- A Node.js based web backend ([API docs here](https://github.com/Palak-Agg/RA27_GRAVITY_WIMDR/tree/master/server))
- A Machine Learning based recommendation system
- A Machine Learnig based Future rate prediction system
